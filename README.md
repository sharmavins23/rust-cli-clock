# Rust CLI Clock

This is a small project rebuilt from
[here](https://github.com/simple-rust-projects/simple-rust-clock) which creates
a rendered updating clock in the CLI through Rust. It's a small project to
simply gain familiarity with the language.

In particular, a lot of the code formatting and style was changed to be more
"rusty", adhering to specific typing, as well as breaking out functionality into
separate functions and simplifying the code.

## Running

Simply type in the command line:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

This will build and execute the program.

## Pairing

This is meant to be a pair project across multiple different programming
languages just to examine the significant differences between handling of
higher-level code. The following is a (growing) list of languages I've
reimplemented this project in:

-   [Rust](https://github.com/sharmavins23/rust-cli-clock)
-   [C](https://github.com/sharmavins23/c-cli-clock)

## Characters

The CLI renders unicode characters from the following dataset:
[Unicode Characters (02500 to 025FF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/025.html).
